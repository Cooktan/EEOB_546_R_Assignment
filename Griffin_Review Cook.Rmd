#Your comments were nice and it made it very easy to see what you were trying to do with your code 

#Data inspection looked good 

#All of your code ran well, no errors or warnings on my end 

#line 217-219 gave an odd output for the chart. The first chart just had a single dot in the middle. The second is all bunched up on one side and hard to read. Even when I zoom into the image it is still stacked on each other or something. The last chart did the same thing for me. 
#I don't know how to fix this (and actually had this issue with one of my charts). But I wanted to bring it to your attention.

#your lines 241-243 did the same bunched up chart

#your other charts all looked nice though. 

#Overall good job! All the code ran on my machine and I had no errors.
