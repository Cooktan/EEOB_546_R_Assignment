# EEOB_546_R_Assignment

## This contains the data for the R assignment.

## For this assignment, it is best to run the code from the .R file as it will have the best code. There are a couple of places in the R-Markdown that a * had to be added at the beginning. Please let me know if ou have any suggestion.
## As I am not a proficient R user, much of the code is probably longer than needed.. The separation of HM and HZ data for proportion info was my greatest fault in this assignment. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

## The .R file will contain code and descriptions throughout. Additionally, the 40 files for chromosomes are with in this file. For these, dash = "-" and the default name Chr_Maize or Chr_Teosinte will contain the data with "?"
