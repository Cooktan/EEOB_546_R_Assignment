# EEOB_546_R_Assignment

## This contains the data for the R assignment.

##For this assignment, it is best to run the code from the .R file as it will have the best code. There are a couple of places in the R-Markdown that a * had to be added at the beginning. Please let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions. As I am not a proficient R user, much of the code is probably longer than needed.. The separation of HM and HZ data for proportion info was my greatest fault in this assignment. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
